# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

**{{DISPLAY_NAME}}** - {{DESCRIPTION}}

- **Tier**: {{TIER}}
- **Organization**: {{ORG}}
- **Domain**: {{DOMAIN}}

## Common Commands

```bash
npm ci              # Install dependencies
npm test            # Run tests
npm run build       # Build
npm run dev         # Development mode
```

### Deployment

Deployments use ChittyConnect for ephemeral credentials:
```bash
# Via reusable workflow (preferred)
gh workflow run deploy.yml

# Manual (requires credentials)
npx wrangler deploy --env production
curl -s https://{{DOMAIN}}/health | jq .
```

## Architecture

This service is part of the ChittyOS ecosystem. See the [chittyops CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/CHITTYOS/chittyops/blob/main/CLAUDE.md) for ecosystem-wide patterns.

### Key Patterns
- Credentials flow through ChittyConnect (`CHITTYCONNECT_API_KEY`)
- LLM/AI functions route through ChittyGateway
- Health endpoint at `/health` returns `{"status":"ok","service":"{{SERVICE_NAME}}"}`
- ChittyBeacon heartbeat every 5 minutes
